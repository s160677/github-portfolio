# Steps for Completing the Assignment

## Step 1
Make a github account if you don't have one already.

## Step 2:
Clone this github repository onto your laptop via a terminal, or use google colab, or kaggle...anywhere where you can edit python code.
There are plenty of online resources which demo how to clone a repo e.g. here: https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/basic-git-commands. 
(Notice that you need to install python if you decide to work on your laptop)

## Step 3: 
Edit the tasks.py file by filling in your solution code.
Run the file to see whether you have errors.
You can also run the grading files to preview whether your solution passes, but you are not allowed to change these files.

## Step 4:
Add this week's kaggle certificate(s) to the repository (course: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python ; https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas). If you received more than one certificate for this week, combine them into one pdf before. Name the file `certificate.pdf` 


## Step 5: 
Push your changes to the repo back to github. The grading will occur automatically but might take a minute.
Again, the add/commit/push workflow of github is explained in various places online: https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/basic-git-commands)
